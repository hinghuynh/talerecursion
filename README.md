A social story telling game that runs native on the iPhone.  Friends create stories and add to the stories of others to shape a truly unique result.

TaleRecursion lets a user create a story and post it on the story wall.  Other users can access the posted story and add a contributing sentence to the tail end of the story until the story is complete (12 sentences are added).  The quirk is that users can only see the last sentence added to any incomplete story.  When the story is finished it can be read in its entirety on the finished stories page.  Users can also add other users as friends and send them push notifications to request participation in a created story.

The front end of TaleRecursion is written entirely in Objective C using Xcode.  The backend of the app is provided by a free online api and server named parse.com.
